# FusionGraphTransformer

```Python```-implementation of two-qubit parity measurements (fusions) on graph states. Up to stabilizer signs, all two-qubit parity measurements from the Pauli group and their effect on a graph or stabilizer state can be simulated and visualized.

## features
- simulate/visualize the effect of two-qubit fusions on graph/stabilizer states.
- simulate/visualize the effect of single-qubit measurements on graph/stabilizer states.
- keeping track of local byproduct operators from the Clifford group (up to stabilizer signs)
- several automated tests, incuding self-consistency checks
