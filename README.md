# FusionGraphTransformer

```Python```-implementation for simulating the effect of so-called fusions on graph states. Upon success, the considered type-II fusions represent a simultaneous measurement of two weight-two operators from the Pauli group.

## features
- simulate the effect of fusions on graph states (up to stabilizer signs).
- keep track of local Clifford byproduct operators (which allows to represent stabilizer states)
- simulate the effect of single-qubit measurements on graph states.
- visualize graph states via ```networkx```
- automated tests and self-consistency checks
